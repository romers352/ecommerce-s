### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible product
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

**Before Submitting A Pull Request:**

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update documentation if necessary
7. Follow the coding standards

**Pull Request Process:**

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you
